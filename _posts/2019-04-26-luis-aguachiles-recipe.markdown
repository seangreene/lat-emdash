<p>One of my favorite dishes to make during the summer is aguachiles. They are perfect for the hot weather and can be enjoyed by the pool or at the beach. Aguachiles is a Mexican dish made of shrimp, submerged in liquid seasoned with chili peppers, lime juice, salt, cilantro, slices of cucumber and slices of onion. Fresh vegetables such as cucumber are usually added. The beauty about aguachile is that you can modify the recepie to your prefered taste. Here is the things you will need to make aguachiles the Luis way</p>



<p><b><u>Ingredients</u></b></p>

<font size="5" color="white">
<dt>
a)1lb. of uncooked shrimp. (try getting shrimp thatâ€™s peeled and deveined to save time) 
<dt/> 
b)15 Limes
<dt/>
c)2 Large cucumbers 
<dt>
d)1 Red onion
<dt/>
e)2 Cups of cilantro 
<dt>
f)3 Large avocados 	
<dt/>
g)1 Cup of chile chipitin (below there is a picture of the chile in case you are not familiar with it)

<dt/>
h)4 Pieces of garlic 
<dt>
i)Salt & Pepper to taste  	
<dt/>
<dt>
e)1 pack of tostadas or saltine crackers 
<dt/>
<br>
<br>
<p><b><u>Directions</u></b></p>

<p> Step 1: You will need to butterfly and devein your shrimp. Using a sharp knife, cut each shrimp lengthwise along the back. For larger shrimp, cut them cleanly into two halves. For smaller shrimp, do not cut all the way through so that the two halves stay together. Once open, remove the gray line of guts running through the center of the shrimp.
<br>
<br>
<p> Step 2: In a bowl, mashed up four garlic cloves, a cup of lime juice and chiles chipitin to taste. I like mine somewhat spicy so I use 10, but if you want it more or less spicy is up to you. Add salt and pepper to taste. You will cooke the shrimp with the marinate you just made. Let the shrimp sit in the marinate for about an hour or less until the shrimp looks and feels ready.
<br>
<br>
<p> Step 3: While the shrimp cooks. In a blender, add, lime juice, cilantro, half of an avocado and a few chiles if you want, and a teaspoon of salt. Blend until the chilies are just broken up. Don't worry about making a smooth paste. A few chunks is not a problem.
<br>
<br>
<p> Step 4: Next, peel the cucumber and scrape out the seeds. Cut into 1/2 inch cubes, when you are finished do the same thing with the onion and sliced it thin. In a bowl smash up the avocados and season to taste with lime and salt.
<br>
<br>
<p> Plating: To plate mix all the ingredients together with the shrimp, add the green sauce, onion and the cucumber and mix them together. Place the mashed up avocado on top of everything and Enjoy!

* There really aren't that many rules. Run a mile, 5 miles or 10 miles anywhere in your neighborhood. You could do it on a bike, too, I guess.

* Complete your activity any time between May 1 and May 8.

* Record your distance and time, preferably with a GPS device and running app. By race week, there will be a form on this website for you to submit your GPS file or report your time using the good ol' honor system.

* Race results will be posted on this website.

* Remember to stay at six feet away from other people and follow all local physical distancing guidelines.

* This is all just for fun and not an official company activity.

<h2 class="headline">What do I get?</h2>

* An excuse to leave the house (exercise is an essential need!)

* If you win, you earn the title of Fastest Person at the L.A. Times.

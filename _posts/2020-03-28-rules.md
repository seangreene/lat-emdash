* Really there aren't any. Run a mile, 5 miles or 10 miles anywhere in your neighborhood. You could do it on a bike, too, I guess.

* Complete your activity any time in April 11 and April 30.

* Record your distance and time, preferably with a GPS device and running app. Send the file or report results using the good ol' honor system.

* Stay six feet away from other people!

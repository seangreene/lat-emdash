	<h1>The Perfect Omelette</h1>
	<p> Need a good hearty breakfast to take on the day? Got someone over early in the morning you need to impress? Need something easy and cheap because you're a broke college student who can't be bothered to learn to cook anything else? Just make some eggs man!</p></div>

	<div style="background-color:lightblue"><ul>Ingredients:
	<li>2 Eggs per omelette</li>
	<li>Garlic powder</li>
	<li>Salt</li>
	<li>Pepper</li>
	<li>Spinach</li>
	<li>Broccoli</li>
	<li>Prosciutto</li>
	<li>Pepper jack cheese</li></ul></div>

	<div style="background-color:lightgreen"><ol>Step-by-step cooking instructions:
	<li>Decide what you want in this shit and prep it all before. I like lots of veggies, but you do you. Cut up your spinach, shred your cheese, etc.</li>
	<li>Crack two eggs into a bowl and season with salt, pepper, and garlic powder to taste.</li>
	<li>Whisk those eggs, dude! Get in there!</li>
	<li>Get a nonstick skillet, put it on the stove, and light it up a little past medium. Let it get hot. We’ll say a minute and a half.</li>
	<li>Drop some butter in there and spread it around to grease the pan -- if you’re using a nonstick skillet, use a bunch of butter!</li>
	<li>Pour your eggs in. Use a spatula to pull from the outside of the pan in and the move the pan to fill the holes with egg. We want it as even as possible</li>
	<li>As it starts to firm up (about a minute or minute and a half), start adding the ingredients. I like to start with a cheese base, then veg, then meat. But it’s your call, man.</li>
	<li>I like my omelettes runny, but if you want them less juicy, that’s cool. Once the cheese is melted in and you have a pretty mix, get in there and flip one side over to make the perfect omelette. If you’re following me to a T, you’re waiting between 30 seconds to a minute after everything is on there before the flip, but this is all done by watching and deciding. It’s fast!</li>
	<li> 50% of the time I mess up the flip and it becomes scrambled eggs. That's ok we're all just playin jazz out here anyways!</li>
	<li>Serve! Hell yeah!</li></ol></div>

	<h2>The Crispy Taters</h2>
	<p> Need something a lil more to consider this a meal? Don't worry I'm right there with ya! Lets get some gosh darn potatoes going too!</p>

	<div style="background-color:lightblue"><ul>More ingredients: 
	<li>Taters</li>
	<li>Olive oil</li>
	<li>Salt</li>
	<li>Pepper</li>
	<li>Rosemary</li>
	<li>Thyme</li></ul></div>

	<div style="background-color:lightgreen"><ol>Step-by-step cooking instructions:
	<li>Wash them taters.</li>
	<li>Dice them taters into bite size-cubes.</li>
	<li>Put ‘em in a bowl of cold water to destrach’em. Drain them. Cover them in water again. Repeat until the water is no longer cloudy. If you wanna plan ahead, you can do this the night before and leave them in the water and covered overnight. They won’t brown!</li>
	<li>Get a cast iron skillet. Turn it up to medium high. Put some olive oil in there. You want the whole pan covered.</li>
	<li>Towel dry the taters.</li>
	<li>Gettin’ some good heat off that oil? Toss them taters in there, man!</li>
	<li>Salt and pepper the taters. Toss in the rosemary and thyme, too. Repeat this to taste as you turn the taters.</li>
	<li>This is where I should tell you a time to cook’em, but it’s really up to you. If you like’em CRISPY like me, they’re gonna go for 10 minutes or longer. Regardless, turn them taters at your leisure.</li>
	<li>They look done to your liking? Great. They’re done. Turn off the heat, dump’em on a paper towel, and then serve’em!</li></ol></div>

	<h1>Chocolate Chip Cookies</h1>
	<h2>Ingredients:</h2>
	<p>4 1/2 cups all-purpose flour</p>
	<p>2 teaspoons baking soda</p>
	<p>2 cups butter, softened. Make sure it is unsalted butter.</p>
	<p>1 1/2 cups packed brown sugar</p>
	<p>1/2 cup white sugar</p>
	<p>2 (3.4 ounce) packages instant vanilla pudding mix</p>
	<p>4 large eggs</p>
	<p>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</p>
	<p>4 cups semisweet chocolate chips</p>
	<p>Do not add walnuts, they taste better without them.</p>
	<h3>Directions:</h3>
	<p>Make sure to preheat your oven to 350 degrees farenheit, since it takes the longest. While preheating, sift together the flour and baking soda onto a sheet of parchment paper, and set aside.</p>
	<p>Take a large bowl and cream together the softened butter, brown sugar and white sugar. In the same bowl, beat in the instant pudding mix until fully blended with no powder visible, then stir in the eggs and vanilla.</p>
	<p>The sifted flour and baking soda mixture will now be blended into the bowl, then finish it up by mixing in chocolate chips.</p>
	<p>This is the fun part of the recipe where you can keep the traditional chocolate chips or switch it up by adding peanut butter or bananas, even oatmeal if you please.</p>
	<p>Get a cookie sheet and either put parchment paper on it or grease it, then take rounded spoonfulls of the cookie dough and place it on the sheet. Larger globs of cookie dough will affect the baking time.</p>
	<p>Bake for about 10 to 12 minutes in the already preheated oven, or bake until golden brown around the edges for the most enjoyable eating experience.</p>

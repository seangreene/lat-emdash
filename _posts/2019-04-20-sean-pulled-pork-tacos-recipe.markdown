	<h1>Gallo pinto</h1>
	
	<p>After grad school, I took a two-week vacation to Costa Rica. I explored cloud forests, beaches and a bunch of awesome foods. I ate my way through plates of <em>casados</em>, bowls of ceviche and empanadas. But the dish I most wanted to take home with me was the humble <em>gallo pinto</em>, a Tico take on rice and beans.</p>
	<p>I learned years later at a Costa Rican coffee shop near my old office that the secret ingredient is Salsa Lizano. If you can't find it at a local market, you can order it on Amazon (of course). If not, cumin will work to replace the smokiness of the Salsa Lizano.</p>
	<div class="ingredients">
		<h3>Ingredients</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>2 tablespoons light-tasting oil (vegetable, mild olive, canola)</li>
			<li>1 red bell pepper, chopped</li>
			<li>1 small yellow onion, chopped</li>
			<li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
			<li>2 cups cooked black beans, in 3/4 cup reserved cooking liquid</li>
			<li>1/4 cup Salsa Lizano&ast;</li>
			<li>3 cups cooked rice, preferably, day-old and refrigerated</li>
			<li>1/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro</li>
		</ul>
	</div>
	
	<div class="steps">
		<h3>Steps</h3>
		<ol>
			<li>Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat until shimmering. Saut√© chopped bell pepper and onions until peppers are soft and onions are translucent, about 6-8 minutes. Add minced garlic and cook for 1 minute, until fragrant.</li>

			<li>Add black beans, reserved cooking liquid, and Salsa Lizano, stirring to combine. Simmer for 5 minutes, until slightly thickened and little bit of the liquid is evaporated. Gently stir in cooked rice and cook until heated through and most of the liquid is absorbed, but not dry, about 3-5 minutes. Stir in chopped cilantro. Season to taste with additional Salsa Lizano (we added about a tablespoon extra).</li>
		</ol>

	<p class="footnote">&ast;Salsa Lizano is essential to this dish. It's available in some Latin markets, much to my pleasant surprise, in the International aisle at my local grocery store, and can be ordered online.</p>

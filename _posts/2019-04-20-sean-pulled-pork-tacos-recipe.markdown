	<h1>Asian pulled pork tacos</h1>
	<p>It was winter of 2017. Everyone I knew was buying an InstantPot, a revolutionary cooking device that promised to change the lives of all who placed one on their kitchen counters. The <a href="https://instantpot.com/" target="_blank">InstantPot</a> is the Swiss army knife of appliances: It's a pressure cooker and slow cooker; it sears and sautés; it has a timer; it makes yogurt.</p>
	<p>As a busy professional with a long train commute, I simply had to have one.</p>
	<p>When it finally came, my housemates and I spent some time researching recipes. YouTube has a treasure trove of recipes for InstantPot, which is where we found this recipe for <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Pf0L6HEdI8&t=1s" target="_blank">Asian pulled pork</a>.</p>
	<p>One spring day while training for my first marathon, I required tacos. Tacos, after all, are running fuel. I went to the store and purchased the finest pork shoulder my local Ralphs had to offer.</p>
	<p>Despite all the whoop-dee-doo about the InstantPot, I decided to use a larger slow cooker I had on hand for maximum taco output.</p>

	<div class="ingredients">
		<h3>Ingredients</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>1 onion</li>
			<li>1 knob ginger</li>
			<li>6 cloves garlic</li>
			<li>2 ¾ lb. pork shoulder (pork butt) (You can use this recipe for 2.5 to 3 lbs. pork)</li>
			<li>2 tsp. salt (kosher or sea salt; use half if using table salt)</li>
			<li>Freshly ground black pepper</li>
			<li>1 Tbsp. oil</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>Seasonings</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>1 ½ cup chicken stock/broth</li>
			<li>5 Tbsp. soy sauce</li>
			<li>2 Tbsp. sake (or dry sherry/Chinese rice wine)</li>
			<li>4 Tbsp. brown sugar (¼ cup packed)</li>
		</ul>
	</div>
	<div class="steps">
		<h3>Steps</h3>
		<ol>
			<li>Gather all the ingredients first.</li>
			<li>Cut 1 onion into big chunks.</li>
			<li>Slice 1 knob of ginger and smash 6 garlic cloves.</li>
			<li>Cut the butcher’s twine and season the pork shoulder (or pork butt) with 2 tsp kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper on all sides.</li>
			<li>Heat a tablespoon of oil in a large pan. Sear all sides of pork shoulder, about 2 minutes per side, then transfer the pork to a clean plate and set aside.</li>
			<li>Add the ginger slices and mashed garlic cloves in the pot, and sauté for 2-3 minutes. Once fragrant, add the chopped onion and coat with oil.</li>
			<li>Add 1 ½ cup chicken stock, 5 Tbsp. soy sauce, and 2 Tbsp. sake.</li>
			<li>And 4 Tbsp. brown sugar and mix well, scraping the juicy brown bits stuck to the bottom of the pot. Add the pork shoulder back into the pot.</li>
			<li>In your slow cooker, cook on high for 5-6 hours or low for 8-10 hours.</li>
			<li>Transfer the pork to a rimmed baking sheet.</li>
			<li>Shred the pork with two forks.</li>
			<li>[Optional] Using a ladle, take out oil/fat (top layer of the liquid). Oil stays near the surface of the liquid, so if you gently submerge the ladle, only oil goes into the ladle, leaving the flavorful liquid behind.  Here I discarded 3/4 cup of oil.</li>
			<li>Put the pork back into the pot, and give everything a good toss so that it can soak up the flavors from the sauce.</li>
			<li>[Optional] Transfer the pork into an oven-safe skillet. Put the skillet under high broil for 3-5 minutes until the shredded pork has nice char.</li>
			<li>Plate your tacos with shredded cabbage, grated carrots, shaved raddish, cilantro and spicy mayonnaise.</li>

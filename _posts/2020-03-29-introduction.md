A virtual race is just like a real 5K or 10K, except you do it whenever and wherever you like.

This race is organized by Los Angeles Times data and graphics journalist Sean Greene for fellow L.A. Times employees. 

Let's all take some time for a cathartic run through the streets of our respective neighborhoods, avoiding other pedestrians and whatever car traffic we may encounter along the way.

<em>It'll be fun.</em> Really!

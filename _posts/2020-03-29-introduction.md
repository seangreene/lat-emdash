A virtual race is just like a real 5K or 10K, except you do it whenever and wherever you like and it does not involve large gatherings of people.

Let's all take some time for a cathartic run through the streets of our respective neighborhoods, avoiding other pedestrians and whatever car traffic we may encounter along the way.

<em>It'll be fun.</em> Really!

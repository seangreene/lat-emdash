	<p><h2> This website is a dive into the world of Mexican dishes I grew up on as a staple of my childhood. </h2></p>	
	<p>Unfortunately, I don't have a cool instapot story or what I did post undergrad life to relate back to my cultural food, but I can share with you the experiences and the joy that comes with being apart of my culture.</p>
	<p>Everyone says Mexican food is the best and now it's our turn to put that theory to the test with these two delicious recipes.</p>

	<h1> Sopes Recipe </h1>
</div>	
	<p> This dish comes from my grandma. Every christmas we'd have a sope eating contest, or maybe it was just in my head... Because I would crush at least 8 sopes everytime, leaving my other family members in the dust. This recipe will happily feed the family for the holidays or at least one adolescent fat boy lineman highschooler. </p>
	<p> <img src= "/m15-recipes/assets/images/Sope.jpg" width="100%"/> </p>
	<h3> Ingredients </h3>

		<li> 1/2 cup roasted, peeled, seeded, and chopped poblano peppers (about 2 medium peppers) </li>
		<li> 1 cup diced tomato </li>
		<li> 2 tablespoons chorizo </li>

		<li> Preheat oven to 425 degrees Fahrenheit, and line a baking sheet with foil and set aside. </li>

		<li> Quickly shape dough into four circles that are 3-inches wide with 1/2-inch rim. Place on baking sheet. </li>
		<li> Spray the dough heavily with nonstick cooking spray. Bake for 30 minutes. Remove pan from oven and spray two or three times more during cooking to make them crisp. </li>
